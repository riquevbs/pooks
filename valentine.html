        <p>Hiii Yannn!!!! This is first time coding something as a gift for someone, so I hope that you like it...
            (it looks so bad aaa) Anyways, this is kind of a letter for you since I thought that this would be a good
            way to convey my feeling about you and our situation. First of all, I'm really glad that someone
            as beautiful, funny, interesting, smart, strong-willed and cute as you is my girlfriend (i honestly dont know
            how i pulled you). Your presence in my life has made it become brighter and more fun everyday, especially when
            we talk and hangout more together :p. I have learned a lot of things from you, those being related to how
            I should treat you and I am sure that you have made me an overall better person, so please keep teaching
            me about love for the rest of our lives ;). I know that it has been extremely hard for us recently due to
            my stupid parents, their dumb beliefs about online relationships and your family making you stressed everyday,
            but I want to believe in us and make this relationship work (im sorry for being selfish). By the way today is like
            my last day of class so I WILL FINALLY BE FREE and we will be able to give more time to each other and 
            plan our expensessss yayyyy. I will be honest with you, I dont consider myself a great person, I have quite a few
            flaws and im working on them, so thank you for being so patient and forgiving with me even though I am such a dumbass
            (i love youuuuu :)). With all of that being said, lets work hard and hope that this relationship will work out,
            since I dont see myself being with anyone else besides you, so I will steal you away :3. Lastly, will you be my
            valentine, Yanan?    
        </p>
